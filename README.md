### Technologies
- React with Vite

### Sitemap

This project generates a `sitemap.xml` automatically during the Vite build.
Set the `SITE_URL` environment variable to the public domain of the site so the
sitemap contains correct URLs. After creation, the build script attempts to ping
Google and Bing to notify them of the new sitemap.
